## What are Passkeys? 

[Passkeys](https://passkeys.dev/) are a replacement for passwords that provides faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a userâ€™s devices â€“ using on-device authentication features like biometric locks. Unlike passwords, passkeys are always strong and phishing-resistant.

Passkeys generated by the main platform authenticator vendors (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) are automatically synchronized across a user's cloud-connected devices. This makes them a compelling alternative to the ubiquitous "password + 2nd-factor" authentication. 

## What is WebAuthn?

[WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn) is a standard API that allows servers to register and authenticate users using public key cryptography.

Instead of using passwords, it leverages a private-public keypair that is unique for each website: the private key remains on the user's device, while the public key and a randomly generated credential ID are sent to the server. The server can then use that public key to prove a userâ€™s identity.

## What's happening here?

Passkeys and WebAuthn are part of the [FIDO2 authentication framework](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/):

This demo shows a high scale, globally distributed Relying Party server implementation as a **single, originless** [Fastly Compute](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/) service written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and compiled to WebAssembly. User data and short-lived challenges are stored in the [KV Store](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/concepts/edge-state/data-stores/), Fastly's edge state system. With this kind of solution running at the edge, you can join the passwordless future today without worrying about managing data or scaling authentication infrastructure.
